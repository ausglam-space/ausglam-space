# Service levels

ausglam.space is run by Hugh Rundle and hosted on Digital Ocean's Singaporean servers. It will probably exist for quite a while, but might not. Whilst every effort will be made, no guarantee of continuation of service is given.

## Community cultural norms

This server is intended for people working in the Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums and Records professions within Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. If this does not describe you, your request to join may be rejected.

This server is for quiet engagement, conversation, and fun. If you wish to find a home for shouting about politics and existential dread, or posting hot takes, please find another server.

Administration, moderation, and community management is being performed on a voluntary basis. Thanks for your patience.

Spam and harassing accounts will be suspended/rejected with extreme prejudice.

## User data

You should only sign up to Aus GLAM Space if you trust Hugh Rundle and Sae Ra Germaine personally with your usage data and messages.

User data will never be sold or transferred to third parties unless compelled by US, Singaporean, or Australian law.

By using this site you give permission for ausglam.space to copy and publish your posts in line with the relevant privacy settings for each post, in order to provide the service and make appropriate data backups.

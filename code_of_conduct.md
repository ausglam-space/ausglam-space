We are a diverse community from a wide range of backgrounds and interests. To ensure that everyone has an enjoyable and enriching experience, please bring a spirit of respect and friendly inquiry to all your interactions.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, education, income, ability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, or religion.

## Be awesome

## Be welcoming

ausglam.space is a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. Everyone is welcome.

## Be respectful

Our community comes from a range of backgrounds and experience levels. Listen and support others to learn. Remember that everyone has their own field of expertise.

## Be kind

Be careful in the words that you choose. Do not insult or put down other members. Endeavour to make your language inclusive.

## Be forgiving

People sometimes make mistakes. Please assume that members and moderators are acting with the best intentions. If you choose to engage with them regarding something you feel is inappropriate or unfair, aim to be diplomatic and forgiving.

## Let us know

If you’re not sure about something or have a concern, feel free to ask @hugh or @saera. If you notice an abusive user please report it.

## Be nice or choose another instance

ausglam.space is dedicated to providing an enjoyable, safe, and harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of members in any form. Accounts violating these rules may be cautioned, silenced or blocked from ausglam.space and may not be given a warning or notice.

## Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or ethnicity, religion, or other personal attributes or identities
* unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices
* sexual images without a clear content warning
* deliberate intimidation
* threats of violence or incitements to violence against an individual or group
* violating any ausglam.space policy
* sustained attacks on someone’s project, work or idea

Sometimes a comment one person thinks is innocuous is offensive to someone else. If someone tells you they find your language or comments offensive, please take that on board graciously.

If we ask participants to stop any harassing behaviour they are expected to comply immediately. Any ausglam.space member can issue a warning to a participant that their behaviour violates the community’s anti-harassment policy.

If a member engages in harassing behaviour, the moderators may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, silencing them, or in extreme cases, banning them from ausglam.space with or without notice.

These rules are based on the [newCardigan](https://newcardigan.org) Code of Conduct. You should join them too :-)
